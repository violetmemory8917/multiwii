#summary feature: ESCs calibration via MultiWii.
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

If the ESCs of the copter  need calibration, a special version of MultiWii can be built, that does nothing but trying to calibrate all attached ESCs. This may come in handy when plugging/unplugging of the cables is undesirable or near impossible (soldered cables)

= How To: =
  # setup all options in config.h to whatever suits your copter 
  # activate the _define_ _ESC_CALIB_CANNOT_FLY_, possibly set high and low values for ESC calibration, if you know what you are doing 
  # compile, upload, run --- cannot fly and will use Buzzer/LEDs to indicate finished calibration (after approx 10 seconds)
  # comment the define again, compile, upload 
  # test carefully with your ESCs calibrated, fly and have fun 

= Details =
If neccessary, the low and high values for the ESCs can be tweaked by changing the values for the defines of ESC_CALIB_LOW  and ESC_CALIB_HIGH 2000
